# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

## Foreword from the Data Analyst

Welcome to my Google Data Analytics Capstone Project! In this case study, I will analyze Cyclisticâ€™s dataset and offer recommendations, just like what a junior data analyst would do in his free timeðŸ˜Š. To complete this task, I will perform the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. I will use the power of Power BI to complete this challenge.

Let's do this!

## Scenario

[Extracted from GDA Capstone CS1]

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a [fictional] bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 

## About Cyclistic

[Extracted from GDA Capstone CS1]

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends. 

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Ask: State the Business Task

Determine how **MEMBERS** and **CASUAL** users use Cyclistic bikes differently. Specifically:
- Analyze the data and identify trends and patterns,
- Create visualizations, and
- Provide key findings and recommendations. 

Let's ask the SMART questions.

  **Specific**. Which bike type is the most preferred by MEMBERS and CASUAL users?

  **Measurable**. What percentage of the total rides is made by the MEMBERS?

  **Action-oriented**. How can we convince the CASUAL users to join the annual membership?

  **Relevant**. What programs can we launch to attract more users to ride bikes?

  **Time-bound**. What trends can we observe from different short-term time periods?


## Prepare: Do the Datasets ROCCC?
